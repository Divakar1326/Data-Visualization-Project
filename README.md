# Data-Visualization-Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Python program designed to visualize demographic data using bar graphs and histograms. The visualizations are created using the popular libraries Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary goal is to provide insights into the gender and age distribution of individuals, as well as their occupations, through various graphical representations.

## Features

- **Bar Graphs**:
  - Gender Distribution
  - Occupation Distribution
  - Average Age by Occupation
  - Gender Distribution by Age Group
  
- **Histograms**:
  - Age Distribution
  - Age Distribution by Gender (Overlaid)
  - Age Distribution with Density Plot (KDE)
  - Age Group Distribution

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Visualization-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data-Visualization-Project
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your CSV file (named `u.csv`) containing demographic data in the project directory. The CSV should include at least the following columns: `gender`, `occupation`, and `age`.

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python your_program_file.py
   ```

3. The program will generate two sets of visualizations:
   - A series of bar graphs showcasing the demographic distributions.
   - A series of histograms depicting the age distribution and its variations.

## Data Format

Ensure that the `u.csv` file has the following structure:

| gender | occupation | age |
|--------|------------|-----|
| Male   | Engineer   | 34  |
| Female | Teacher    | 29  |
| Male   | Artist     | 45  |
| ...    | ...        | ... |

## Example Output

The program will output four bar graphs and four histograms based on the data provided. The visualizations will display the following information:

- **Gender Distribution**: A count of males and females in the dataset.
- **Occupation Distribution**: A count of individuals for each occupation.
- **Average Age by Occupation**: The mean age of individuals grouped by their occupation.
- **Gender Distribution by Age Group**: A stacked bar graph showing gender distribution across different age groups.
- **Histograms**: Various histograms that display the age distribution in multiple formats.
